# Task ID: 19
# Title: Write Unit and Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 13, 15, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all core components.
# Details:
Write tests for file handling, `xlcalculator` integration, code generation logic (static/runtime), variable naming, cross-sheet references, CLI parsing, API endpoints, and sandbox execution.

# Test Strategy:
Run the test suite. Ensure high code coverage and that all test cases pass.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plan Test Strategy and Setup Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall testing strategy, scope (unit, integration), tools, and set up the testing framework and necessary dependencies for comprehensive testing.
### Details:
Identify testing frameworks (e.g., pytest), mocking libraries, and set up CI integration if applicable. Define test data requirements covering various features like cross-sheet references and variable naming.

## 2. Develop Unit Tests for Core Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Write unit tests for isolated components like `xlcalculator` integration, variable naming conventions, and basic formula parsing/evaluation logic.
### Details:
Focus on testing functions and classes in isolation. Use mocks for external dependencies. Ensure tests cover various formula types and naming rules.

## 3. Develop Unit Tests for File Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create unit tests to verify the application's ability to read from and write to various file formats, handling different data types, sheets, and edge cases relevant to cross-sheet references.
### Details:
Test file parsing, data extraction, and output generation logic. Use temporary files or in-memory file systems for testing different file structures.

## 4. Develop Integration Tests for Code Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Write integration tests to verify the static and runtime code generation process, including correct translation of formulas, variable references, and complex cross-sheet references.
### Details:
Test the pipeline from parsing input (using file handling logic) to generating executable code (using core logic). Use sample files with complex formulas, variable names, and cross-sheet links.

## 5. Develop Integration Tests for CLI [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Create integration tests for the command-line interface, ensuring it correctly processes arguments, handles file inputs/outputs, and executes the core application logic including code generation and execution.
### Details:
Test different CLI commands, options, and argument combinations. Verify output format and error handling for various scenarios, including file processing and execution.

## 6. Develop Integration Tests for API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Write integration tests for the application's API endpoints, verifying correct request handling, data processing, and response generation, including triggering code generation and execution.
### Details:
Test different API routes, request methods, and data payloads. Ensure proper interaction with the underlying application logic (file handling, code generation, execution) and correct API responses.

## 7. Develop Integration Tests for Sandbox Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Develop integration tests to verify the execution of generated code within the sandbox environment, ensuring security, resource limits, correct output, and handling of runtime errors.
### Details:
Test execution with various generated code samples, including those with potential errors, resource-intensive operations, or complex logic involving cross-sheet data. Verify sandbox isolation and output capture.
