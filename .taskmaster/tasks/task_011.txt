# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement REST API Endpoint for Conversion
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the REST API endpoint for file upload and code generation using FastAPI.
# Details:
Define a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., `/convert`) that accepts file uploads. Integrate the file handling, parsing, evaluation, and code generation logic. Return the generated script or a link to it.

# Test Strategy:
Use tools like `curl` or Postman to send file upload requests to the API. Verify it returns the correct response and generated script.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup FastAPI App and Define Base Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the FastAPI application and define the basic structure for the `/convert` POST endpoint without implementing the core logic yet.
### Details:
Create the main application file (e.g., `main.py`). Import FastAPI. Create a `FastAPI` instance. Define a `POST` endpoint at `/convert`. Add a placeholder return value.

## 2. Implement File Upload Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Modify the `/convert` endpoint to accept a file upload using `FastAPI.UploadFile`.
### Details:
Update the `/convert` POST endpoint function signature to accept a parameter of type `UploadFile`. Read the content of the uploaded file.

## 3. Add Input Validation (File Type and Size) [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement validation logic to check the uploaded file's type and size before processing.
### Details:
Check the `content_type` of the `UploadFile`. Define allowed file types (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.csv`). Check the file size, potentially by reading chunks or using file system info if saved temporarily. Raise an `HTTPException` for invalid files.

## 4. Integrate File Parsing Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Call the existing file parsing function with the content of the uploaded file.
### Details:
Import the parsing function. Pass the file content (or path if saved) to the parser. Handle potential exceptions raised by the parser.

## 5. Integrate Evaluation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Call the existing evaluation function with the output from the parsing step.
### Details:
Import the evaluation function. Pass the parsed data structure to the evaluator. Handle potential exceptions raised by the evaluator.

## 6. Integrate Code Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Call the existing code generation function with the output from the evaluation step.
### Details:
Import the code generation function. Pass the evaluation results to the code generator. The generator should return the final script string.

## 7. Define and Implement Success Response Format [done]
### Dependencies: 11.6
### Description: Format the generated script into a successful HTTP response.
### Details:
Define a Pydantic model for the successful response body (e.g., `{'script': '...'}`). Return an `HTTPResponse` with status code 200 and the generated script formatted according to the model.

## 8. Implement Specific Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 11.6
### Description: Catch specific exceptions raised by the parsing, evaluation, and generation steps and map them to appropriate HTTP exceptions.
### Details:
Wrap the calls to parsing, evaluation, and generation functions in `try...except` blocks. Catch known custom exceptions from these modules. Raise `HTTPException` with relevant status codes (e.g., 422 Unprocessable Entity, 500 Internal Server Error) and detail messages based on the caught exception.

## 9. Define and Implement Error Response Format [done]
### Dependencies: 11.8
### Description: Ensure consistent formatting for all error responses.
### Details:
Define a Pydantic model for error responses (e.g., `{'detail': 'Error message', 'code': 'specific_error_code'}`). Ensure that all `HTTPException` instances raised (including those from validation in step 3 and specific errors in step 8) return a response body conforming to this model.

## 10. Add API Documentation and Final Review [done]
### Dependencies: 11.7, 11.9
### Description: Add docstrings and type hints for OpenAPI documentation and perform a final review of security considerations.
### Details:
Add docstrings to the endpoint function describing its purpose, parameters, and responses. Use type hints extensively. FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI docs from this. Review implemented security measures (validation, error handling) and consider any missing aspects like rate limiting (though not required for this task, note it if applicable).
