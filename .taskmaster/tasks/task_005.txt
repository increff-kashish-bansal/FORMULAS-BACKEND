# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Variable Naming Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the logic to determine variable names for cells based on the specified hierarchy: Named Range > Header (1st row) > Cell Reference.
# Details:
For each cell containing a formula or value that will be referenced: Check if it has a defined Excel Named Range. If not, check if it's in a column with a header in the first row. If neither, use the cell reference format (e.g., `cell_A1`). Handle ambiguities like merged headers by flattening and suffixing (e.g., `Revenue_Q2_1`). Log warnings for empty or malformed headers leading to fallback.

# Test Strategy:
Create test sheets covering all naming scenarios: named ranges, clear headers, merged headers, empty headers, and no clear headers. Verify that the generated variable names match the expected output for each case according to the specified hierarchy and ambiguity rules. Check that warnings are logged correctly for fallbacks.
