# Task ID: 5
# Title: Extract Formula Dependency Relationships
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the logic to extract formula dependency relationships from the `xlcalculator` model.
# Details:
Analyze the `xlcalculator` model object to understand which cells/formulas depend on others. This information is crucial for generating ordered Python code.

# Test Strategy:
Use a test workbook with simple dependencies. Verify the extracted dependency graph matches expectations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Understand xlcalculator Model Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and understand how `xlcalculator` internally represents cell and formula dependencies within its model objects.
### Details:
Research and understand how `xlcalculator` internally represents cell and formula dependencies within its model objects.

## 2. Identify Dependency Extraction Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Identify the specific attributes or methods within the `xlcalculator` model objects that expose cell and formula dependency information.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Logic to Traverse Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop code to traverse the dependency graph provided by `xlcalculator` to determine the correct order of formula evaluation.
