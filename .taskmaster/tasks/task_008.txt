# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Variable Naming Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the variable naming logic based on Named Range, Header, or Cell Reference hierarchy.
# Details:
Implement the hierarchy: Named Range > Header > Cell Reference (e.g., `cell_A1`). Handle fallbacks for missing/merged headers. Store mapping from Excel cell to generated variable name.

# Test Strategy:
Test with workbooks having named ranges, headers, and only cell references. Verify variable names in generated code follow the hierarchy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Named Range Variable Naming [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the logic to extract named ranges from the `xlcalculator` model and use them as Python variable names.
### Details:


## 2. Implement Header-based Variable Naming [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the logic to extract header information from Excel sheets and use it to generate Python variable names. Handle cases with missing or merged headers by falling back to cell references.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Cell Reference-based Variable Naming (Fallback) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure that if neither named ranges nor headers are available, the system defaults to using cleaned cell references (e.g., A1 becomes cell_A1) as Python variable names.
