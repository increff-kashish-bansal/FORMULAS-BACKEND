# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Static Python Code Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core code generation logic, translating simple formulas to static Python expressions where possible.
# Details:
Iterate through evaluated cells/formulas. For simple cases (e.g., `A1+B1`), generate equivalent Python code (`cell_A1 + cell_B1`). Use placeholder comments for complex/unsupported formulas initially.

# Test Strategy:
Generate code for a workbook with simple math/logic formulas. Verify the output Python script contains correct static expressions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Excel Function to Python Mapping [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a mapping or a set of rules to translate common Excel functions (e.g., SUM, IF, AVERAGE) into their equivalent Python operations or standard library functions. Consider a dictionary-based approach for direct mappings.
### Details:


## 2. Generate Python Code for Simple Formulas [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement the logic to translate simple Excel formulas (e.g., A1+B1, IF(A1>0, X, Y)) into equivalent static Python expressions. This should involve using the defined mapping and handling basic arithmetic and logical operations.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Basic Excel Formula Lexer/Tokenizer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to tokenize an Excel formula string into meaningful parts (e.g., cell references, operators, function names, literals).
