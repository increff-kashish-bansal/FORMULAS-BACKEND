# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Sandboxed Execution Environment
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a sandboxed execution environment for running the generated Python scripts securely.
# Details:
Implement execution using `subprocess` with resource limits (`resource` module) or within a Docker container with AppArmor/SECCOMP profiles. Enforce CPU (30s), RAM (128MB), and network restrictions.

# Test Strategy:
Run test scripts designed to exceed resource limits or access network. Verify the sandbox correctly terminates execution.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research Python Sandboxing Techniques [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research various Python sandboxing techniques, including `subprocess`, `resource` module, Docker, and other secure execution methods.

Researched Python sandboxing techniques. Key findings include: 1. `subprocess` with `resource` module: Allows setting CPU, memory, and file size limits for child processes. Good for basic resource control. 2. `seccomp`: Linux kernel feature for syscall filtering, stronger security but OS-specific. 3. Docker/Containerization: Strong process isolation, consistent environments, ideal for production but complex setup. 4. `secimport`: Python package using `dtrace` for fine-grained module confinement. For this task, `subprocess` with `resource` module is the most practical initial approach.

## 2. Implement subprocess based execution [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a Python function that executes a given script using `subprocess` and captures its output.
### Details:


## 3. Enforce CPU and RAM restrictions using the `resource` module [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement resource limits for CPU (30s) and RAM (128MB) for the sandboxed execution using the `resource` module and `preexec_fn`.
### Details:


## 4. Implement basic network restriction (if feasible within `subprocess`) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement basic network restriction for the sandboxed execution, if feasible within the `subprocess` and `resource` module context.
