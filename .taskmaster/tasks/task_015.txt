# Task ID: 15
# Title: Integrate Logging into CLI and API Output
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate logging output into the CLI (stderr) and API (JSON/log file).
# Details:
For CLI, direct warnings/errors to stderr. For API, include a `warnings` array in the JSON response and provide a mechanism (e.g., URL) to download the full log file (`log.txt`).

# Test Strategy:
Trigger warnings/errors via CLI and API. Verify log output appears correctly in stderr/JSON/log file.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure CLI Logging to Stderr [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the logging configuration to route warning and error level messages specifically to the standard error stream (stderr) when the application is executed in a command-line interface context.
### Details:
Identify the application's entry point for CLI execution. Implement logic to detect CLI mode. Configure the logging handler/formatter to direct appropriate levels to stderr.

## 2. Integrate Warnings into API JSON Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance API request processing to capture warning-level log messages generated during the handling of a specific request and include them as a structured field within the standard JSON response body.
### Details:
Determine how to associate logs with a specific request context. Define the structure for including warnings in the JSON response (e.g., a 'warnings' array). Implement the mechanism to collect and format warnings for inclusion.

## 3. Develop API Endpoint for Full Log Access [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated API endpoint that allows authorized users to retrieve the complete application log file content, providing a mechanism for debugging and monitoring.
### Details:
Design the endpoint URL and authentication/authorization mechanism. Implement file reading logic to access the main application log file. Consider pagination or streaming for large log files. Define the response format (e.g., plain text, JSON lines).
