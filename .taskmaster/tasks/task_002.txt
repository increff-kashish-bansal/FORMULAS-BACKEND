# Task ID: 2
# Title: Install Core Dependencies (`xlcalculator`, FastAPI)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Install necessary core dependencies, including `xlcalculator` and potentially a web framework like FastAPI.
# Details:
Use the chosen dependency manager (Poetry/Pipenv/pip) to add `xlcalculator` and `fastapi` (or similar async framework) to the project dependencies. Ensure dependencies are locked.

# Test Strategy:
Verify dependencies are installed and importable in a test script.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Choose dependency manager and initialize project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select a Python dependency manager (Poetry, Pipenv, or pip) and perform the initial project setup or environment creation.
### Details:
Consider project needs and team preference when choosing between Poetry, Pipenv, or standard pip with requirements files. Execute the necessary command to initialize the project or environment.

## 2. Install dependencies and lock versions [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Install the `xlcalculator` and `fastapi` libraries using the chosen dependency manager and generate a lock file to record exact versions.
### Details:
Use the appropriate command for the selected manager (e.g., `poetry add`, `pipenv install`, `pip install` followed by locking) to add `xlcalculator` and `fastapi`. Ensure a lock file (e.g., `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `requirements.lock`) is created or updated.
